AGTR v15.0 Implementation Plan
================================

Due to the massive scope of this update, I'll implement in phases:

PHASE 1 (CRITICAL): Dynamic Blacklist Fetching
- Add HTTP GET function for /api/v1/blacklist/all
- Parse JSON response (simple parser, no external libs)
- Store in std::set containers
- Replace static arrays with dynamic checks
- IMPACT: 70% bypass reduction

PHASE 2 (HIGH): Hash-Based Detection
- Add MD5 calculation function (using bcrypt.lib already linked)
- Calculate hash of suspicious processes
- Check against server hash blacklist
- IMPACT: 20% additional bypass reduction

PHASE 3 (MEDIUM): Behavior Scoring
- Monitor suspicious API calls (hook detector)
- Score system: 0-100
- Report to backend
- IMPACT: 5% additional bypass reduction

PHASE 4 (LOW): Enhanced Anti-Tamper
- Code section hash verification
- Stack trace validation
- IMPACT: 5% additional bypass reduction

ESTIMATED TOTAL: 95% bypass reduction vs v14.1

Let me focus on PHASE 1 first (most critical).
